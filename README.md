# Elastic Enterprise Search Connectors 

![logo](logo-enterprise-search.png)

The home of Elastic Enterprise Connector Packages. Use connector packages to
customize connectors such as Workplace Search Content Sources for advanced use
cases.

Note #1: The connector framework is a tech preview feature. Tech preview features
are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of general release
(GA) features. Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.

Note #2: If you are looking for the version of the connector framework that is described in [Bring Your Own Connector](https://www.elastic.co/blog/bring-your-own-enterprise-search-connector) blog article that was describing the version from the 8.3 release, it would be advisable to check out/fork the [relevant branch](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/8.3).

### System Requirements

Under Linux or Macos, you can run the application using Docker or directly on your system.

For the latter you will need:
- rbenv (see [rbenv installation](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation))
- bundler (see [bundler installation](https://bundler.io/); for version, see [.bundler-version](./.bundler-version))
- yq (see [yq installation](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install))

### Windows support

We provide an experimental support for Window 10.

You can run the `win32\install.bat` script to have an unattended installation of Ruby
and the tools we use. Once installed, you can run the `specs` using `make.bat`

### Running the connector

There's a `Makefile` in the root of the repository. You can run the `make` command to build the project:

```bash
make build
```

This command, apart from building the code, will also create the [configuration file](config/connectors.yml).

You can run the connector application using this command:

```bash
make run
```

However, `make run` needs some required data to be present in the [configuration file](config/connectors.yml), namely, the connector package ID and the service type. There's also some settings for the ICU Analysis Plugin (see below) that are required for applying correct mappings to the content indices. Example of the configuration values:

```yaml
connector_package_id: my-connector-package-id
service_type: gitlab

# how often the connector should check for scheduled sync jobs
idle_timeout: 10

# ICU Analysis Plugin is used (false by default)
# turn this on if the ICU plugin - International Components for Unicode - is installed in your Elasticsearch instance
# see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-icu.html
use_analysis_icu: false
# language to use for the content indices
content_language_code: en
```

Each connector application instance represents a single connector package. This means that currently, it's not supported to try and synchronize multiple service types in the same connector application. It's also recommended to use a separate index for each connector package. Otherwise, it's not guaranteed that the connector will be able to synchronize the data correctly.

### Running the connector with Docker

You can run the web server using our Dockerfile.

First, build the Docker image with:

```shell
make build-docker
```

The stdout will display the generated API key.

Then, you can run the server within Docker with:

```shell
make run-docker
```

### Updating configuration values

You can update the git branch, revision and project version in the `connectors.yml` file to your current values by
running this command:

```
make refresh_config
```

This command is also included in every `make run`, so when you re-run the app using the makefile, these values are updated, too.
They are exposed in the root endpoint mentioned above. 

### Configuration

By design, we try to avoid duplicating any metadata in the project, like its
**version**. For this reason, we have one single configuration file in
`config/connectors.yml` that contains all the metadata needed for runtime and
buildtime. It can be used from the dev tree or in a production deployment.

The Gem spec and the connectors use that config file to get
the metadata they need.

The build process might change it on-the-fly when the Gem is created but will
not change the one in the dev tree.

When the connector application is launched, it will pick `config/connectors.yml` by default, 
but you can provide your own configuration file by using the **CONNECTORS_CONFIG** env.
