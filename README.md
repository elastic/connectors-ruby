# Elastic Ruby connectors

![logo](logo-enterprise-search.png)

The home of Elastic connector service and native connectors in Ruby language. This repository contains the framework for customizing Elastic native connectors, or writing your own connectors for advanced use cases.

If you are looking for the implementation in Python, See [connectors-python](https://github.com/elastic/connectors-python).

**The connector will be operated by an administrative user from within Kibana.**

> Note: The connector framework is a tech preview feature. Tech preview features are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of general release (GA) features. Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.
