# Elastic Enterprise Search Connectors

![logo](logo-enterprise-search.png)

The home of Elastic Enterprise Connector Clients. Use connector clients to
customize connectors such as Workplace Search Content Sources for advanced use
cases.

Note #1: The connector framework is a tech preview feature. Tech preview features
are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of general release
(GA) features. Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.

Note #2: The `main` branch of this repository is currently being heavily reworked. If you want to use the
connector clients now, it would be advisable to check out/fork the [latest stable branch](https://github.com/elastic/connectors-ruby/tree/8.3).

### System Requirements

Under Linux or Macos, you can run the application using Docker or directly on your system.

For the latter you will need:
- rbenv (see [rbenv installation](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation))
- bundler (see [bundler installation](https://bundler.io/); for version, see [.bundler-version](./.bundler-version))
- yq (see [yq installation](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install))

### Windows support

We provide an experimental support for Window 10.

You can run the `win32\install.bat` script to have an unattended installation of Ruby
and the tools we use. Once installed, you can run the `specs` using `make.bat`

### Running the connector

There's a `Makefile` in the root of the repository. You can run the `make` command to build the project:

```bash
make build
```

This command, apart from building the code, will also create the configuration file `config/connectors.yml`.

You can run the connector application using this command:

```bash
make run
```

However, `make run` needs some required data to be present in the configuration file `config/connectors.yml`, namely, the connector package ID and the service type. 

```yaml
connector_package_id: my-connector-package-id
service_type: gitlab
```

There's also some optional settings for the ICU Analysis Plugin (see below) that are required for applying correct mappings to the content indices.

> NOTE: these are only needed for registering connectors bypassing the Kibana UI, e.g. [via the CLI](#the-cli).

Example of the configuration values:

```yaml
# ICU Analysis Plugin is used (false by default)
# turn this on if the ICU plugin - International Components for Unicode - is installed in your Elasticsearch instance
# see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-icu.html
use_analysis_icu: false
# language to use for the content indices
content_language_code: en
```

Each connector application instance represents a single connector package. This means that currently, it's not supported to try and synchronize multiple service types in the same connector application. It's also recommended to use a separate index for each connector package. Otherwise, it's not guaranteed that the connector will be able to synchronize the data correctly.

The connector package ID is generated when the connector is first registered with Enterprise Search. You can find the connector package ID in the Enterprise Search UI, on the page called `Content` under the `Enterprise Search` tab. When you click the `Create new index` button on this page, you will see several ingestion methods available. One of them is called `Build a connector package` - this is what the current repository represents. The connector package ID is created after you specify the index name and select the index language from a provided select list. This connector package ID should then be added to the `connector_package_id` setting in the configuration file `config/connectors.yml`, together with the language code that you selected for the index as `content_language_code`.

There's also another option to generate a connector package ID _omitting the Kibana UI_ - [via the experimental CLI](#cli_registering_connectors). 

The service_type is the type of service that the connector is connecting to. It's used to determine the correct connector implementation to use.

After the connector is registered and the ID is stored in the configuration file, you can run the connector application using the `make run` command.

> NOTE: by default, the connector has no schedule. So when you register a connector, it will NOT be immediately synchronized. See the [Scheduling connectors](#cli_scheduling_connectors) section for more information. 

### Running the connector with Docker

You can run the web server using our Dockerfile.

First, build the Docker image with:

```shell
make build-docker
```

Then, you can run the server within Docker with:

```shell
make run-docker
```

## <a name="the-cli"></a> The CLI

There's an experimental CLI that you can also use to interact with the connector. 

> NOTE: the CLI is a work in progress and though available, should be used at your own risk. It's not yet a fully functional feature and has no parity with the Enterprise Search UI. However, it's a good starting point for experimenting with the connector and it does contain some useful commands.

Running this command in the root of the repository will bring up the CLI menu:

```bash
make exec_cli
```

### <a name="cli_registering_connectors"></a> Registering connectors

The menu option that you need to use is `register connector with Elasticsearch (register)`. It will bring up the following prompt:

```bash
You already have registered a connector with ID: CHANGEME. Registering a new connector will overwrite the existing one.
Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n)
```

The `CHANGEME` is a placeholder that we're using in the example config file, so you can safely overlook this warning and proceed. In case the connector was already registered, the real connector package ID will be displayed instead. You should confirm the overwrite if you want to discard the previously registered connector and its data. You will also need to manually drop the index that was created for the previously registered connector, especially if you want to use the same name for the newly created index.

> NOTE: if you plan to use this index to create an App Search engine, then its name should start with the prefix `search-` as described in the [relevant documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/elasticsearch-engines-create.html). The [Elasticsearch index engines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/elasticsearch-engines-create.html) feature is currently in technical preview.

Confirming the overwrite will result in the following output:

```bash
Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n)
y
Please enter index name for data ingestion. Use only letters, underscored and dashes.

D, [2022-07-13T15:38:49.292685 #97176] DEBUG -- : Connector settings not found for connector_package_id: changeme
I, [2022-07-13T15:38:49.331152 #97176]  INFO -- : Successfully registered connector one with ID 1WGc7YEBRpZatOEsiw4f
Please store connector ID in config file and restart the program.
Press any key to continue...
```

As said, pressing any key will again display the CLI menu. You need to select the `end the program` option to exit the CLI, or just press CTRL+C in the terminal. Then, grab the ID for the newly registered connector and put it into the configuration file under `connector_package_id`, replacing whatever ID there was previously.

### <a name="cli_scheduling_connectors"></a> Scheduling connectors

#### Scheduling connectors via the CLI

The CLI has a menu option called `enable connector scheduling (scheduling_on)`.

```bash
Please select the command:
--> enable connector scheduling (scheduling_on)
```

Selecting this menu option will result in the following prompt:

```bash
Please enter a valid crontab expression for scheduling. Previous schedule was: * * * * *.
```

In case there was no previous schedule, the empty value will be displayed.
As you can see, the expression is a crontab expression. The syntax is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Syntax). You can use an online tool to generate a crontab expression, for example [crontab-generator](https://crontab.guru/).

Suppose we want to change this to every two minutes:

```bash
Please enter a valid crontab expression for scheduling. Previous schedule was: * * * * *.
*/2 * * * *
I, [2022-07-13T16:30:02.840031 #1436]  INFO -- : Successfully updated field scheduling connector 1WGc7YEBRpZatOEsiw4f
Scheduling enabled! Start synchronization to see it in action.
Press any key to continue...
```

As you can see, the scheduling has been updated. Now, the `make run` command will actually try to synchronize the data every two minutes.

#### Disabling connector scheduling via the CLI

#### Scheduling connectors via the Kibana UI

Use the menu option called `disable connector scheduling (scheduling_off)` to disable the connector scheduling. This will result in the following prompt:

```bash
Are you sure you want to disable scheduling for connector 1WGc7YEBRpZatOEsiw4f? (y/n)
y
I, [2022-07-14T15:03:22.675244 #91015]  INFO -- : Successfully updated field scheduling connector 1WGc7YEBRpZatOEsiw4f
Scheduling disabled! Starting synchronization will have no effect now.
Press any key to continue...
```

After this, `make run` will not try to synchronize the data anymore.

#### Updating the values of configurable fields

The configurable fields are the fields that are part of the connector configuration. They are connector-specific and their list is defined in the `configurable_fields` method of the connector class. The CLI has a menu option called `update the values of configurable fields (set_configurable_field)` to update the values of the configurable fields. This menu option only works with one selected field at a time, so if you need to reconfigure several fields, you need to select and change them one by one. The flow looks approximately like this:

```bash
 
Please select the configurable field:
--> Base URL (current value: {"label"=>"API Base Url", "value"=>"https://gitlab.com/api/v4"}, default: https://gitlab.com/api/v4) (base_url)
Please enter the new value:
https://some/other/url
I, [2022-07-14T15:08:21.909539 #92618]  INFO -- : Successfully updated field configuration connector 1WGc7YEBRpZatOEsiw4f
Configurable field is updated!
Press any key to continue...
```

In this example, we updated the `base_url` field to the new value.

> NOTE: In general, it's not recommended to put any sensitive data (credentials, API keys, etc.) in the configurable fields. It's better to store them in a `config/connectors.yml` or another local file which is NOT under source control, or read them from the environment variables. The configuration file path is described in the section [Local connector properties](#local-connector-properties). 

#### Reading the values of configurable fields

The menu command is called `read the stored values of configurable fields (read_configurable_fields)` and it will read both the currently persisted values from Elasticsearch and the defaults that are specified in the `configurable_fields` method of the connector class. If there are several fields, the command will display them all as a list. The flow looks this way:

```bash
Persisted values of configurable fields:
* Base URL - current value: {"label"=>"Base URL", "value"=>"https://some/other/url"}, default: https://gitlab.com/api/v4
Press any key to continue...  
```

#### Doing an ad-hoc synchronization

Use the `start one-time synchronization NOW (sync_now)` menu option to do a one-off synchronization. This will not start the synchronization in the background, but will instead do it immediately. After the synchronization is done, the control will return back to the CLI.

```bash

#### Checking the third-party service status

Use the CLI menu option called `check the status of a third-party service`. This will result in the following output:

```bash
Checking status...
{:status=>"OK", :statusCode=>200, :message=>"Connected to GitLab Connector"}

Status checked!
Press any key to continue...
```

The connector implements a simple health check. It will check the status of the third-party service and return a JSON object with the status. The health check implementation may vary from connector to connector.

### Updating configuration file values

You can update the git branch, revision and project version in the `connectors.yml` file to your current values by
running this command:

```
make refresh_config
```

This command is also included in every `make run`, so when you re-run the app using the makefile, these values are updated, too.
They are exposed in the root endpoint mentioned above.


#### Kicking the tires with the CLI

> NOTE: As stated above, this is an experimental feature. It is not yet ready for production use and is therefore not a recommended way to set up the connector. However, if you want to just try registering and synchronizing a connector to quickly see if it works, you can use the CLI. The flow would look like this:

 * use the `register` command to create a new connector and get a connector package ID;
 * write the connector package ID into the `connectors.yml` file;
 * use the `scheduling_on` command to set the synchronization schedule;
 * do the `make run` command to start the synchronization flow.

Alternatively, you can run the one-time synchronization manually by using the `sync_now` CLI command instead of the last step.

### Configuration

By design, we try to avoid duplicating any metadata in the project, like its
**version**. For this reason, we have one single configuration file in
[config/connectors.yml](config/connectors.yml) that contains all the metadata needed for runtime and
build time. It can be used from the dev tree or in a production deployment.

The Gem spec and the connectors use that config file to get
the metadata they need.

The build process might change it on-the-fly when the Gem is created but will
not change the one in the dev tree.

When the connector application is launched, it will pick `config/connectors.yml` by default,
but you can provide your own configuration file by using the **CONNECTORS_CONFIG** env.


### Connector protocol

These connectors are built according to our [Connector Protocol](./docs/CONNECTOR_PROTOCOL.md). If you want to build your own connector or update an existing, please make sure to adhere to that protocol.

#### <a name="local-connector-properties></a>Local connector properties

Sensitive data, such as API keys, credentials, etc. could also be stored in the configuration file, provided that it's NOT under source control. Every connector reads this file on creation and is looking for the section called `<service_type>`, where `service_type` is the name that was provided in the corresponding property of the configuration file. You can look at it as a short identifier allowing you to specify which third-party service is behind the connector, or anything to help identify which connector you're running. Example:

```yaml
service_type: gitlab
gitlab:
  api_token: <your-api-key>
```

This way, you're saying that the connector is for GitLab, and there you're providing the API key for GitLab. And it also means that the `GitLab::Connector` class will have a @local_configuration variable that will contain whatever is in the `gitlab` section of the configuration file. So inside the connector class, you can access the API key like this:

```ruby
@local_configuration[:api_token]
```
