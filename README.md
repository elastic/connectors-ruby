# Connectors
The new home of Elastic Connectors


### Building
run `./mvnw clean install`

### Generating Java from Ruby
This project uses Ruby source files (for historical reasons), and generates java code from them. To generate the code,
the Maven Exec Plugin is used to execute the `script/build_jruby.sh` script for a given module. As an example,
to run this goal for the `hello-world-connector`, run:

```shell
./mvnw clean exec:exec@build-ruby -pl hello-world-connector
```

The output generated Java source files can then be found in `hello-world-connector/target/generated-sources/`


### Testing
run `./mvnw clean test`

#### Testing Ruby changes only
Sometimes, you may care less about testing all of the pieces of the project, or even about testing Java code generation
and its tests. In these instances, you can run just rspec tests for your ruby files.

```shell
./mvnw clean exec:exec@test-ruby -pl hello-world-connector
```
